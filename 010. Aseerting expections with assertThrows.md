In JUnit 5, you can use the `assertThrows` method to validate that a method throws the expected exception. This approach is simpler and more elegant compared to using a `try-catch` block manually. Here’s how `assertThrows` works and how it can be used effectively to test exceptions.

### **How `assertThrows` Works:**

The `assertThrows` method is used to assert that a specific exception is thrown during the execution of a code block. The method signature for `assertThrows` is:

```java
<T extends Throwable> T assertThrows(Class<T> expectedType, Executable executable);
```

- **`expectedType`**: This is the class of the expected exception (e.g., `ArithmeticException.class`).
- **`executable`**: This is the lambda or block of code that you expect to throw the exception.

### **Steps for Using `assertThrows`:**

1. **Specify the Expected Exception**: 
   Pass the expected exception type (like `ArithmeticException.class`).
   
2. **Provide the Executable**: 
   Pass a lambda or method reference that will execute the code expected to throw the exception.

3. **Verify**: 
   If the exception is thrown, the test passes. If the exception is not thrown or a different exception is thrown, the test fails.

### **Example with ArithmeticException (Divide by Zero)**:

Here’s an example based on the divide method, where you expect an exception when dividing by zero:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;

@Test
void testDivideByZero() {
    // Arrange
    MathUtils mathUtils = new MathUtils();

    // Act & Assert
    assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> mathUtils.divide(1, 0), "Divide by 0 should throw ArithmeticException");
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> mathUtils.divide(1, 0))`**: This asserts that calling `mathUtils.divide(1, 0)` will throw an `ArithmeticException`.
- **The third argument**: The message is optional but can be used to clarify what the expected behavior is if the test fails.

### **Failure Scenarios:**
- If no exception is thrown, JUnit will fail the test.
- If a different exception (like `NullPointerException`) is thrown, JUnit will fail the test and report that an unexpected exception was thrown.

### **What Happens Under the Hood:**

When you use `assertThrows`, JUnit will automatically handle the `try-catch` block internally. This simplifies the process and reduces boilerplate code. You don't need to manually handle the exception or use `fail()` statements.

### **Example with Incorrect Exception Type:**

```java
@Test
void testDivideByZeroWrongException() {
    // This will fail because we expect ArithmeticException, but we're incorrectly expecting NullPointerException
    assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> mathUtils.divide(1, 0), "Divide by 0 should throw ArithmeticException");
}
```

In this case, the test will fail, and JUnit will show the message `Unexpected exception type thrown: ArithmeticException` along with the details of the exception.

### **Advantages of `assertThrows`:**
1. **Simplicity**: It reduces boilerplate code by eliminating the need for `try-catch` blocks and makes the tests more readable.
2. **Lambda Expressions**: Leverages Java 8's lambda expressions, making it easier to pass executable code.
3. **Cleaner Tests**: Using `assertThrows` ensures that only the expected exception is checked, providing better control over the exception handling in tests.

By using `assertThrows`, you can easily verify that the methods in your code are throwing the expected exceptions in edge cases, improving the test coverage and reliability of your codebase.
