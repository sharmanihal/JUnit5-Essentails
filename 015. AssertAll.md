The **`assertAll`** method in JUnit 5 provides an elegant way to execute multiple assertions together, reporting a collective result. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to test multiple related conditions in a single method and care about their overall success or failure without needing separate test methods.

---

### **Why Use `assertAll`?**

1. **Compactness**: You can group multiple assertions together in a concise and readable way.
2. **Execution of All Assertions**: Unlike traditional assertions, which may stop execution upon the first failure, `assertAll` executes all assertions, making it easier to debug multiple issues in one run.
3. **Single Responsibility**: Reduces boilerplate for simple tests where no additional setup is needed.
4. **Better Failure Reporting**: Displays which assertions failed within the group.

### **Example: Testing a `multiply` Method**

#### **Scenario**

You want to test various cases for a `multiply` method:
1. Multiplying two positive numbers.
2. Multiplying by zero.
3. Multiplying a positive and a negative number.

---

#### **Code Example**

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

@DisplayName("MathUtils Multiply Method Tests")
class MathUtilsTest {

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should handle multiple scenarios for multiplication")
    void testMultiply() {
        assertAll("Testing various multiplication scenarios",
            () -> assertEquals(4, MathUtils.multiply(2, 2), "2 x 2 should equal 4"),
            () -> assertEquals(0, MathUtils.multiply(2, 0), "2 x 0 should equal 0"),
            () -> assertEquals(-2, MathUtils.multiply(2, -1), "2 x -1 should equal -2"),
            () -> assertEquals(9, MathUtils.multiply(3, 3), "3 x 3 should equal 9")
        );
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. **`assertAll`**:
   - Groups multiple assertions into a single block.
   - If any assertion fails, the test fails, and JUnit provides detailed information about which assertion(s) failed.

2. **Lambda Expressions**:
   - Each assertion is wrapped in a lambda (or method reference), making the code concise.
   - Lambdas allow delayed execution, which is critical for `assertAll` to run all assertions, even if one fails.

3. **Failure Reporting**:
   - If any assertion fails, the test output clearly identifies the failed case and its corresponding message.

4. **Descriptive Failure Messages**:
   - Use meaningful messages for each assertion to understand failure causes without diving into the code.

---

### **Running the Test**

If all assertions pass, the output will indicate a green (successful) test run. If any assertion fails, the output will resemble this:

```
org.opentest4j.MultipleFailuresError: Testing various multiplication scenarios
Multiple Failures (2 failures)
	Expected :4
	Actual   :5
	2 x 2 should equal 4
	Expected :0
	Actual   :2
	2 x 0 should equal 0
```

This provides:
- The number of failed assertions.
- Details of each failure, including the expected and actual values, as well as the custom failure message.
