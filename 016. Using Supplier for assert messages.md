JUnit 5 provides a mechanism for **lazy evaluation of assertion messages** through the use of lambdas. This feature helps optimize performance by deferring the computation of failure messages until they are actually needed, i.e., when a test fails.

### **Why is Lazy Evaluation Important?**

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - In traditional assertions, the failure message string is computed even when the test passes, which can be wasteful, especially if the computation involves resource-intensive operations.
   - By deferring computation, resources are consumed only when necessary.

2. **Clean Code**:
   - Avoids cluttering the test logic with pre-computed error messages.

### **How It Works**

In JUnit 5, assertions like `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` allow you to pass a **lambda function** as the failure message. The lambda is a **supplier** (`Supplier<String>`), which means:
- It is a method that generates a value (in this case, a string).
- The lambda is only executed if the assertion fails.

### **Example: Traditional vs Lazy Message Evaluation**

#### **Traditional Approach**

```java
@Test
void testLazyEvaluationTraditional() {
    int expected = 10;
    int actual = 5;

    // Failure message is always computed, even if the test passes.
    assertEquals(expected, actual, "Expected " + expected + ", but got " + actual);
}
```

**Problem**:  
The string `"Expected 10, but got 5"` is computed eagerly, regardless of the test result.

---

#### **Lazy Evaluation with Lambda**

```java
@Test
void testLazyEvaluationWithLambda() {
    int expected = 10;
    int actual = 5;

    // Failure message is computed only if the test fails.
    assertEquals(expected, actual, () -> "Expected " + expected + ", but got " + actual);
}
```

**Benefit**:  
The string `"Expected 10, but got 5"` is computed only when the test fails, saving unnecessary computation if the test passes.
