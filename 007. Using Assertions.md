### Writing Your First Unit Test in JUnit 5

#### **Key Concepts Covered**
1. **Assertions for Validation**:
   - Use `assertEquals` from the JUnit library to compare the expected and actual values.
   - This ensures your code behaves as expected without manually printing results to the console.

2. **Steps to Create a Test for `add` Method**:
   - **Instance Creation**:
     ```java
     MathUtils mathUtils = new MathUtils();
     ```
     This creates an instance of the class under test.
   - **Input Preparation**:
     Define the inputs and expected outputs.
     ```java
     int expected = 2;
     int actual = mathUtils.add(1, 1);
     ```
   - **Assertion**:
     Use the `assertEquals` method to validate.
     ```java
     assertEquals(expected, actual);
     ```

3. **Using Assertions**:
   - Assertions simplify test validation and reporting.
   - The `@Test` annotated method automatically hooks into JUnit's reporting mechanism, so:
     - **Green Bar**: Test passed.
     - **Red Bar**: Test failed with details, e.g., `"Expected: 2 but was: 1"`.

4. **IDE Intergration**:
   - Right-click on the test class or method.
   - Run the test using **Run As > JUnit Test**.
   - Results are displayed in the **JUnit Tab**, showing the test's success or failure.

### Example Code: Test for the `add` Method
```java
package io.javabrains;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MathUtilsTest {

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        // Arrange: Create an instance and set inputs
        MathUtils mathUtils = new MathUtils();
        int expected = 2;
        int actual = mathUtils.add(1, 1);
        
        // Assert: Validate the result
        assertEquals(expected, actual, "The add method should add two numbers correctly.");
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- **Arrange**: Set up the test environment (inputs, expected results).
- **Act**: Execute the method under test.
- **Assert**: Validate the result using assertions.

5. **Handling Failures**:
   - When the test fails, JUnit provides detailed feedback:
     - What was expected vs. what was received.
     - Easy to identify and fix the issue without adding custom logging.

By leveraging JUnit's built-in features, you ensure consistent, reliable, and maintainable testing across your codebase.
