The annotations `@DisplayName` and `@Disabled` in JUnit 5 are very handy for managing and organizing your test cases, especially in large projects or when following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices. Here's a detailed explanation of both:

---

### **`@DisplayName` Annotation**

- **Purpose**:
  - Provides a **human-readable name** for test methods or test classes.
  - Makes it easier to understand the purpose of a test when viewing test results, especially in large test suites.

- **Why Use It?**
  - By default, test results display the method name. If the method names are descriptive but lengthy, or if you want to provide more context about what the test does, `@DisplayName` can be used.
  - Particularly useful for non-technical stakeholders who might look at test reports or for developers debugging issues quickly.

- **Syntax**:
  ```java
  @Test
  @DisplayName("Should add two numbers correctly")
  void testAdd() {
      // Test logic here
  }
  ```

- **Example in Practice**:
  ```java
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

  class MathUtilsTest {

      @Test
      @DisplayName("Addition of two positive numbers")
      void testAddition() {
          int result = 2 + 3;
          Assertions.assertEquals(5, result);
      }

      @Test
      @DisplayName("Subtraction when the second number is larger")
      void testSubtraction() {
          int result = 2 - 5;
          Assertions.assertEquals(-3, result);
      }
  }
  ```

  - **Output in Test Console**:
    ```
    Addition of two positive numbers ✔
    Subtraction when the second number is larger ✔
    ```

### **`@Disabled` Annotation**

- **Purpose**:
  - Skips the execution of the annotated test or test class.
  - Useful for marking tests that are **work in progress**, **broken**, or **temporarily irrelevant**.

- **Why Use It?**
  - During **TDD**, you might write tests that fail until the corresponding functionality is implemented. Use `@Disabled` to skip such tests until they're ready.
  - If a test is temporarily not needed (e.g., a feature is under development or unavailable), `@Disabled` prevents it from failing the build.

- **Syntax**:
  ```java
  @Test
  @Disabled("Feature not yet implemented")
  void testNotImplemented() {
      // Test logic here
  }
  ```

- **Behavior**:
  - Skipped tests are clearly marked in the test results with a unique indicator (e.g., a line-through icon).
  - Skipped tests do not affect the test results or build status.

- **Example in Practice**:
  ```java
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

  class MathUtilsTest {

      @Test
      @Disabled("Division by zero feature not implemented")
      void testDivisionByZero() {
          Assertions.fail("This test should not run");
      }
  }
  ```

  - **Output in Test Console**:
    ```
    Test skipped: Division by zero feature not implemented
    ```

### **Best Practices**:

1. **`@DisplayName`**:
   - Use descriptive display names for tests to improve clarity in test reports.
   - Follow a standard format (e.g., `Should <action> when <condition>`).

2. **`@Disabled`**:
   - Always include a **reason** when disabling a test (`@Disabled("reason here")`).
   - Use it sparingly to avoid leaving tests disabled indefinitely. Regularly review and either fix or remove them.

---

### **Combining Both Annotations**:

You can use both `@DisplayName` and `@Disabled` together for clarity:

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Verify behavior when input is null")
@Disabled("Pending implementation of null input handling")
void testNullInput() {
    // Test logic here
}
```

This indicates clearly in reports:
1. What the test is about (`@DisplayName`).
2. Why it’s skipped (`@Disabled`).
