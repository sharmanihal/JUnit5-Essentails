In **JUnit testing**, coverage types refer to the different aspects of your code that are tested by your test cases. Measuring code coverage ensures that your tests adequately verify the behavior of your code. Below are the primary types of coverage used in JUnit testing:

---

### 1. **Statement Coverage**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that each executable statement in the code has been executed at least once by the test cases.
   - **Purpose**: Identifies which lines of code are not tested.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     public int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b; // This line should be executed in the test case.
     }
     ```
     If the test case invokes `add(2, 3)`, this line will be covered.

---

### 2. **Branch Coverage**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that every branch (true/false decision) in the code is tested.
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that all possible execution paths, including if-else blocks, are covered.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     public String checkNumber(int num) {
         if (num > 0) {
             return "Positive";
         } else {
             return "Negative or Zero";
         }
     }
     ```
     - A test case with `num = 5` (true branch) and `num = -1` (false branch) ensures branch coverage.

---

### 3. **Condition Coverage (Predicate Coverage)**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that each individual condition in a decision is tested for both true and false outcomes.
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on testing the boolean conditions within decisions.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     public boolean isEligible(int age, boolean isMember) {
         return age > 18 && isMember;
     }
     ```
     - Test cases must evaluate both `age > 18` and `isMember` as true and false independently.

---

### 4. **Path Coverage**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that every possible path through a method or function is executed.
   - **Purpose**: Aims for thorough testing by covering all combinations of branches.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     public String validate(int a, int b) {
         if (a > 0) {
             if (b > 0) {
                 return "Both positive";
             }
         }
         return "Not both positive";
     }
     ```
     - Test cases should cover all paths:
       1. `a > 0` and `b > 0`
       2. `a > 0` and `b <= 0`
       3. `a <= 0`

---

### 5. **Function Coverage**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that every function or method in the code is called at least once during testing.
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that all methods are being tested.
   - **Example**: A test case should invoke all methods in the class at least once.

---

### 6. **Loop Coverage**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that loops in the code are tested for different scenarios:
     - No iteration (loop is skipped).
     - One iteration.
     - Multiple iterations.
   - **Purpose**: Validates the behavior of loops in all edge cases.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     public int sum(int[] arr) {
         int total = 0;
         for (int num : arr) {
             total += num;
         }
         return total;
     }
     ```
     - Test cases:
       1. Empty array (no iteration).
       2. Array with one element (one iteration).
       3. Array with multiple elements (multiple iterations).

---

### 7. **Class Coverage**
   - **Definition**: Ensures that all classes in the application have been tested.
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that every class has some level of test coverage.

---

### Code Coverage Tools for JUnit:
JUnit does not natively provide coverage analysis but integrates well with tools like:
   - **JaCoCo**: Java Code Coverage Library.
   - **Cobertura**: Another popular coverage tool.
   - **EclEmma**: Eclipse plugin for JaCoCo.

By measuring these coverage types, you ensure your tests comprehensively verify the correctness of your code, improving its quality and robustness.
