The **`@RepeatedTest`** annotation in JUnit 5 allows you to run a single test method multiple times. This is useful for scenarios where repetition is necessary to ensure reliability or consistency, such as when testing non-deterministic systems, randomized algorithms, or stress-testing under repeated conditions.

---

### **Key Features of `@RepeatedTest`**

1. **Automatic Repetition**:
   - The test runs the specified number of times.
   - The framework handles iteration and reporting.

2. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - JUnit provides a readable display name for each repetition, e.g., `Repetition 1 of 3`.

3. **Customizable Behavior**:
   - Using the **`RepetitionInfo`** object, you can customize behavior for each iteration.

---

### **Basic Usage**

To run a test multiple times, annotate it with `@RepeatedTest` and specify the number of repetitions.

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.RepeatedTest;

class RepeatedTestExample {

    @RepeatedTest(3) // Runs this test 3 times
    void testWithRepetition() {
        System.out.println("Executing repeated test");
        // Add your test logic here
    }
}
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Executing repeated test
Executing repeated test
Executing repeated test
```

---

### **Using `RepetitionInfo`**

The `RepetitionInfo` object provides information about the current and total repetitions. You can inject it as a parameter into the test method.

#### Example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.RepeatedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.RepetitionInfo;

class RepeatedTestExample {

    @RepeatedTest(5) // Run 5 repetitions
    void testWithRepetitionInfo(RepetitionInfo repetitionInfo) {
        int currentRepetition = repetitionInfo.getCurrentRepetition();
        int totalRepetitions = repetitionInfo.getTotalRepetitions();
        
        System.out.printf("Repetition %d of %d%n", currentRepetition, totalRepetitions);

        // Custom logic for specific repetitions
        if (currentRepetition == 1) {
            System.out.println("Performing setup for the first repetition.");
        } else if (currentRepetition == totalRepetitions) {
            System.out.println("Performing teardown for the last repetition.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Repetition 1 of 5
Performing setup for the first repetition.

Repetition 2 of 5

Repetition 3 of 5

Repetition 4 of 5

Repetition 5 of 5
Performing teardown for the last repetition.
```

---

### **Failure Handling**

If any repetition fails, the entire test is marked as failed. This ensures that all repetitions must pass for the test to succeed.

#### Example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.RepeatedTest;

class RepeatedTestExample {

    private int counter = 0;

    @RepeatedTest(3)
    void testWithFailure() {
        counter++;
        if (counter == 2) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Intentional failure on repetition 2");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Repetition 1 of 3 PASSED
Repetition 2 of 3 FAILED
Repetition 3 of 3 SKIPPED
```

---

### **Practical Use Cases**

1. **Testing Randomized Behavior**:
   - To verify a method consistently handles random input correctly.

2. **Stress Testing**:
   - Run a function repeatedly to check for resource leaks or performance degradation.

3. **Non-Deterministic Systems**:
   - Test systems where outcomes may vary due to timing, parallelism, or external dependencies.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Run the same test with varied configurations based on repetition count.

#### Example:

```java
@RepeatedTest(10)
void testRandomBehavior() {
    int randomValue = new Random().nextInt(100);
    assertTrue(randomValue < 100); // Should always pass
}
```

The `@RepeatedTest` annotation is a flexible tool for scenarios requiring multiple iterations of the same logic, enhancing test reliability and exposing hidden issues through repetition.
