Here are the **most commonly used assert methods in JUnit 5**, along with their definitions and examples:

---

### 1. **`assertEquals(expected, actual, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that two values are equal.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertEquals(5, result, "The result should be 5.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: `expected` and `actual` are not equal.

---

### 2. **`assertNotEquals(unexpected, actual, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that two values are not equal.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertNotEquals(5, result, "The result should not be 5.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: `unexpected` and `actual` are equal.

---

### 3. **`assertTrue(condition, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that a condition is `true`.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertTrue(result > 0, "Result should be positive.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The condition is `false`.

---

### 4. **`assertFalse(condition, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that a condition is `false`.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertFalse(result < 0, "Result should not be negative.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The condition is `true`.

---

### 5. **`assertNull(object, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that an object is `null`.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertNull(myObject, "Object should be null.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The object is not `null`.

---

### 6. **`assertNotNull(object, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that an object is not `null`.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertNotNull(myObject, "Object should not be null.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The object is `null`.

---

### 7. **`assertSame(expected, actual, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that two objects refer to the same object (i.e., same reference).
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertSame(expectedObject, actualObject, "Objects should be the same.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The objects are not the same (different references).

---

### 8. **`assertNotSame(unexpected, actual, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that two objects do not refer to the same object.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertNotSame(unexpectedObject, actualObject, "Objects should not be the same.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The objects refer to the same reference.

---

### 9. **`assertArrayEquals(expectedArray, actualArray, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that two arrays are equal in terms of length and content.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertArrayEquals(new int[] {1, 2, 3}, resultArray, "Arrays should be equal.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The arrays differ in length or content.

---

### 10. **`assertThrows(expectedType, executable, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that a block of code throws an exception of a specified type.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
         myService.someMethod(null);
     }, "Should throw IllegalArgumentException.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The exception type is not thrown.

---

### 11. **`assertDoesNotThrow(executable, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that a block of code does not throw any exception.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {
         myService.someMethod(validInput);
     }, "Should not throw an exception.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: Any exception is thrown.

---

### 12. **`fail(message)`**
   - **Definition**: Fails the test unconditionally with a given message.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     fail("This test is intentionally failed.");
     ```

---

### 13. **`assertTimeout(duration, executable, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Asserts that a block of code executes within a specified time duration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(100), () -> {
         Thread.sleep(50);
     }, "Code should execute within 100ms.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The code execution exceeds the given duration.

---

### 14. **`assertTimeoutPreemptively(duration, executable, message)`**
   - **Definition**: Similar to `assertTimeout`, but interrupts the code if the duration is exceeded.
   - **Usage**:
     ```java
     assertTimeoutPreemptively(Duration.ofMillis(100), () -> {
         Thread.sleep(150);
     }, "Execution should not exceed 100ms.");
     ```
   - **Fails if**: The code execution exceeds the given duration.

These assertions cover most scenarios for validating expected outcomes, object states, and exception handling in unit tests. They make JUnit tests powerful and expressive while maintaining simplicity.
