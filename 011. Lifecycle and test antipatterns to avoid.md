In JUnit 5, the **test lifecycle** refers to the sequence of events during the creation, execution, and destruction of test instances and their associated resources. Understanding the test lifecycle is important for writing reliable and independent tests.

### **JUnit 5 Test Lifecycle**

1. **Creation of Test Class Instance**: 
   JUnit 5 creates a new instance of the test class for each test method execution. This ensures that each test method is isolated, preventing shared state from interfering with tests. 

   - For example, when you run multiple test methods, each test gets its own fresh instance of the test class.
   
2. **Test Method Execution**: 
   Each method annotated with `@Test` is executed independently, without assuming a specific order unless explicitly specified.

   - **Note**: By default, JUnit does not guarantee the order in which tests are executed. However, you can control the order using the `@TestMethodOrder` annotation if necessary. It is generally discouraged to make tests dependent on the order, as it can introduce hidden dependencies.

3. **Destruction of Test Class Instance**: 
   After the test method finishes execution, the test class instance is discarded. This ensures that no test data is shared between tests.

### **Test Hooks in the Lifecycle**

JUnit 5 provides lifecycle hooks, which are methods that you can use to execute code at specific points in the test lifecycle.

#### **Common Lifecycle Annotations in JUnit 5**

1. **`@BeforeAll`**: 
   - This annotation is used on a static method that is executed **once before all test methods** in the class.
   - Typically used for setup tasks that are expensive and should be done only once (e.g., database connections, server setup).
   - Example:
     ```java
     @BeforeAll
     static void setupBeforeClass() {
         System.out.println("Setup before all tests.");
     }
     ```

2. **`@BeforeEach`**:
   - This annotation is used on methods that are executed **before each test method** in the class.
   - Typically used for initializing test data or preparing the environment for each test.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @BeforeEach
     void setupBeforeEach() {
         System.out.println("Setup before each test.");
     }
     ```

3. **`@AfterAll`**: 
   - This annotation is used on a static method that is executed **once after all test methods** in the class.
   - Typically used for cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @AfterAll
     static void tearDownAfterClass() {
         System.out.println("Cleanup after all tests.");
     }
     ```

4. **`@AfterEach`**:
   - This annotation is used on methods that are executed **after each test method**.
   - Typically used for cleanup tasks that should happen after every test.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @AfterEach
     void tearDownAfterEach() {
         System.out.println("Cleanup after each test.");
     }
     ```

### **Test Independence and Avoiding Shared State**

A critical point in JUnit 5 is that each test method should be **independent**. In earlier versions of JUnit (e.g., JUnit 4), it was possible to use shared state across test methods by defining member variables. This could lead to tests affecting each other if the order was changed.

JUnit 5 mitigates this problem by creating a new instance of the test class for each test method. Therefore, **shared state between tests is not allowed**, and member variables cannot retain values across test executions. This ensures that tests do not rely on the execution order and prevents state leaks.

For example, the following would not be allowed in JUnit 5:

```java
public class MathUtilsTest {
    private int value = 10; // shared state

    @Test
    void test1() {
        value = 20;
        // Test logic
    }

    @Test
    void test2() {
        assertEquals(10, value); // This will fail because value is 10 again.
    }
}
```

Since JUnit 5 creates a new instance for each test, the second test (`test2()`) will not see the changes made in `test1()`, and the test will pass as expected.


### You might be wondring well if new instance is created of the test class for each test case, how will BeforeAll run only once ?

### **Understanding Static Methods in JUnit**

- **`@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll`** methods **must be static** in JUnit 5 because they are executed before any instance of the test class is created (in the case of `@BeforeAll`) or after all the test methods in the class have run (in the case of `@AfterAll`). 
- This is necessary because **JUnit needs to run these methods without having created an instance of the test class** yet, which is possible only if the method is static.
  
### **Why Static for `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll`?**

- **Static methods** do not depend on an instance of the class to be called. So, they can run **before** an instance of the test class is created (for `@BeforeAll`) or **after** all the tests have finished (for `@AfterAll`).
- **Non-static methods** rely on an instance of the class, which is only created once the test class instance is initialized. If these methods were not static, JUnit wouldn't be able to call them before or after the instance creation process.

### **The Lifecycle in Detail**:

1. **`@BeforeAll`**: 
   - This method is called **once before any test methods run**.
   - Since no instance of the test class exists yet, it needs to be `static` so it can be called without instantiating the class.
   - If you try to mark `@BeforeAll` as non-static, you will get an error because the JUnit framework can't invoke a non-static method before the class instance is created.

2. **`@BeforeEach`**:
   - This method runs **before each test method**.
   - It **does not need to be static**, because by the time itâ€™s called, JUnit has already created an instance of the test class for the current test.

3. **`@Test`**:
   - Each test method runs independently.
   - JUnit creates a new instance of the test class for every test method, ensuring that tests are independent of each other.

4. **`@AfterEach`**:
   - This method runs **after each test method**.
   - Like `@BeforeEach`, it **does not need to be static**, as JUnit has already created an instance of the test class.

5. **`@AfterAll`**:
   - This method is called **once after all test methods have run**.
   - It also **needs to be static**, for the same reason as `@BeforeAll`: JUnit must call it after all tests have been executed, but before the test class instance is destroyed.

### **Example with Static and Non-static Methods**:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

class MathUtilsTest {

    @BeforeAll
    static void beforeAll() {
        System.out.println("Before all tests");
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void beforeEach() {
        System.out.println("Before each test");
    }

    @Test
    void testAdd() {
        System.out.println("Running add test");
    }

    @Test
    void testSubtract() {
        System.out.println("Running subtract test");
    }

    @AfterEach
    void afterEach() {
        System.out.println("After each test");
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void afterAll() {
        System.out.println("After all tests");
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Before all tests
Before each test
Running add test
After each test
Before each test
Running subtract test
After each test
After all tests
```

- **`beforeAll()`** and **`afterAll()`** are static and run once before and after all the test methods.
- **`beforeEach()`** and **`afterEach()`** run before and after each individual test method, and do not need to be static.

### **Summary**:

- **`@BeforeAll`** and **`@AfterAll`** must be static to execute before any instance of the test class is created.
- **`@BeforeEach`** and **`@AfterEach`** are instance methods and run before and after each test method, respectively, using a new instance of the test class.
