### Why Use a Testing Framework Like JUnit?

#### The Challenge Without a Framework  
When testing a simple `add` method in a `Calculator` class, you might think, "Why not write code myself to verify it?" Here’s how a manual testing process typically unfolds:  
1. **Prepare the test case:** Create inputs and expected outputs.  
2. **Run the code:** Call the method and capture the actual result.  
3. **Verify results:** Compare the expected vs. actual values.  
4. **Alert on failure:** Notify the developer if the test fails.  

This works fine for one or two tests but quickly becomes cumbersome when you scale to multiple test cases or more complex scenarios.

#### The JUnit Advantage  
JUnit simplifies and standardizes testing by handling repetitive tasks:  
1. **Executing the test:** You focus on defining the test logic; JUnit runs it for you.  
2. **Verifying results:** Instead of manual comparison, JUnit provides APIs like `assertEquals(expected, actual)` to handle validation.  
3. **Reporting failures:** JUnit automatically generates reports highlighting failed tests, guiding developers to the issue.  

#### Why This Matters  
1. **Consistency:** A framework ensures uniformity in how tests are written, executed, and reported.  
2. **Scalability:** Whether it’s one test or a thousand, JUnit scales effortlessly.  
3. **Time-saving:** Automating repetitive tasks frees developers to focus on writing effective tests.  

#### Takeaway  
JUnit removes the boilerplate around testing, enabling developers to concentrate on the logic. It’s not just about running tests; it’s about creating a robust, maintainable testing ecosystem.
