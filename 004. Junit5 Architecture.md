### JUnit 5 Architecture Overview

JUnit 5 introduces a modular and flexible architecture designed to address the limitations of JUnit 4. Here's how it’s structured:

---

#### 1. **JUnit Platform**
- **Core of JUnit 5**: Provides the foundation for the framework.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Acts as the test engine.
  - Offers an execution context and infrastructure for running tests.
  - Enables integration with IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans, as well as build tools like Maven and Gradle.
- **Not Directly Used by Developers**: The platform works behind the scenes, enabling other components.

---

#### 2. **JUnit Jupiter**
- **What Developers Use**: This is the new programming and extension model.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provides the APIs and annotations developers interact with, such as `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, and `@AfterEach`.
  - Implements the new testing syntax and paradigms.
- **Why "Jupiter"?**
  - Named after the fifth planet (Jupiter) since this is JUnit 5.
  - Shares the "ju" prefix with JUnit for continuity.

---

#### 3. **JUnit Vintage**
- **Backward Compatibility Layer**: Ensures older JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests can run in JUnit 5.
- **Why Vintage?**
  - Helps developers migrate gradually.
  - Allows mixed projects where both new (JUnit 5) and old (JUnit 3/4) tests can coexist.

---

#### 4. **Third-Party Extensions**
- **Custom Testing Frameworks**: Developers can integrate their custom testing APIs and still use the JUnit Platform.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Allows creating new test annotations or behavior while leveraging the JUnit Platform for test execution.

#### Maven Dependencies for JUnit 5
Depending on the type of tests and features you want, you'll need specific dependencies:

1. **JUnit Jupiter**: For new JUnit 5 tests.
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
       <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   ```
   
2. **JUnit Vintage**: To run JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests.
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
       <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

3. **JUnit Platform**: For test execution.
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.junit.platform</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit-platform-runner</artifactId>
       <version>1.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

---

### How JUnit 5 Works in IDEs
- IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans integrate directly with the **JUnit Platform**.
- When you right-click and choose "Run Test," the IDE interacts with the platform to execute the specified tests.
- Tests written using JUnit Jupiter annotations (`@Test`) are identified and executed by the platform.

---

### Key Features of JUnit Jupiter
- **Annotations**:
  - `@Test`: Marks a method as a test case.
  - `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach`: Setup and teardown methods for individual tests.
  - `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll`: Setup and teardown methods for the entire test class.
  - `@DisplayName`: Provides custom names for test cases.

- **Extension Model**:
  - Jupiter allows you to create extensions to add behavior (e.g., logging, custom assertions).

### What’s Next?
Now that the theory is covered, it’s time to dive into coding:
1. Create a **new Maven project** in Eclipse.
2. Add the necessary **JUnit 5 dependencies**.
3. Write and run a sample test using JUnit Jupiter to see how it works in action.

Let’s start building your first test case!
