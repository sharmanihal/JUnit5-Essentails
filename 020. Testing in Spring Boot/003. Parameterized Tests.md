# Parameterized Tests in JUnit 5

## Problem Statement
When testing a simple method like adding two numbers, without parameterized tests, you would:
- Either write multiple assertions in a single test method.
- Or create separate test methods for each test case.

This approach can lead to redundant code and is not scalable.

## Solution: Use Parameterized Tests
JUnit 5 provides the `@ParameterizedTest` annotation, which allows you to run the same test logic with different sets of input values.

### Example: Testing Addition

```java
@ParameterizedTest
@CsvSource({
        "1,1,2",
        "2,10,12",
        "3,-10,-7"
})
public void testAdd(int a, int b, int expected) {
    assertEquals(expected, a + b);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **`@ParameterizedTest` Annotation**
   - Indicates that the test method is a parameterized test.

2. **`@CsvSource` Annotation**
   - Provides the test data as a list of comma-separated values.
   - Each line represents a test case.
   - The parameters in the test method correspond to the values in each row.
     - Example: `"1,1,2"` maps to `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `expected = 2`.

3. **Test Logic**
   - The method is executed once for each set of input values.
   - The `assertEquals` verifies the output for each case.

### Advantages
- **Scalability:** Easily add or modify test cases by updating the input data.
- **Readability:** Test cases are concise and clearly defined.
- **Reusability:** The same logic is reused for multiple inputs.

## Notes
- You can use other sources for parameterized tests, such as `@ValueSource`, `@MethodSource`, `@EnumSource`, and `@CsvSources`.
- Make sure to include the JUnit 5 library in your dependencies to use parameterized tests.
